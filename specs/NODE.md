# SPEC — NODE

A **node** is the unit of execution: one bunker agent bound to one project and one repo.

## Manifest (`$HOME/.node/node.json`)

```json
{
  "node_id": "<agent id>",
  "project": "crier",
  "repo": {"origin": "git@…", "ref": "main", "path": "/home/<uid>/repo"},
  "harness": {"name": "hermes", "version": "0.19.0", "port": 10800},
  "bus": {"agent_id": "node-crier", "base": "http://crier.example:8767"},
  "freshness": {
    "status": "PASS", "branch": "main", "head": "04fc3986f448", "origin_main": "04fc3986f448",
    "behind": 0, "dirty_files": [], "differing_files": [],
    "ladder": "PASS", "reason": "", "measured_at": "2026-11-05T18:40:00Z"
  },
  "created_by": "project-node.sh v1",
  "created_at": "2026-10-29T18:40:00Z"
}
```

The manifest is the node's identity: a scheduler target names `node_id`; the control host reads
the manifest to know where the artifacts are.

`freshness` is the checkout the node will actually work, measured by layer 40 with
`scripts/node_freshness.py` (`--workdir`) or the node-side fallback when the clone does not carry
the probe (`scripts/project-node.sh`, `freshness_measure`). `status` is the **check's own**
verdict — `FAIL` for a dirty checkout, because an uncommitted local edit on a node is a finding —
while `ladder` is how the provisioning ladder graded it at provision time (`PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL`).
`dirty_files` and `differing_files` are the paths an operator has to act on, and they are the
reason the object exists: the paths belong upstream, not in the node's tree.

## Layers (each has a check that can fail)

| Layer | Establishes | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| 00 preflight | arch, disk ≥ floor, memory, and HTTP 200 from the only two endpoints this layer probes — `$CRIER_URL/health` and `https://pypi.org/simple/` (`scripts/project-node.sh:190`). Each is requested with the method that measures it: `https://pypi.org/simple/` with **HEAD**, because the index is ~48 MB and a GET under an 8 s budget reports `000` on a healthy link (measured on `cf-node` 2026-11-05 — GET `000` after 44 MB received, HEAD `200` in 0.29 s); `$CRIER_URL/health` with **GET**, because a HEAD against that GET-only handler answers `405`, which is a method verdict and not a reachability fault (same host, same tick). With `CRIER_URL` unset the reach block is skipped entirely and the layer prints `FAIL crier_url` instead of two probe rows. Reachability to a Go module proxy is **not** measured by this layer: it probes these two endpoints only. The Go proxy is graded one layer later — layer 10 resolves the pinned `rsc.io/quote@v1.5.2` through the node's own `GOPROXY` when the kind set includes Go (`scripts/project-node.sh`, `go_proxy_row`), which supersedes the CF-164 statement that `GOPROXY` / `GOPRIVATE` appeared nowhere under `scripts/` (CF-218). Layer 00 also measures the **footprint** this node will occupy — checkout, Go and Node toolchains, harness home, node state and a declared module cache — and admits the total plus 2 GiB working room against free space, and the total against the resolved floor (`scripts/node_hygiene.py footprint`, CF-003) | — |
| 10 base | the toolchain the project **kind** needs — `go`: `scripts/install-go.sh` installs the digest-pinned `go1.26.5` user-space archive during `--apply`, reads that binary's `go version` back, and resolves `rsc.io/quote@v1.5.2` through the node's own `GOPROXY` with a cold `GOMODCACHE`, `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, `GOSUMDB=off`, empty `GOFLAGS`, and a 30 s timeout; `--check` remains read-only and names the absent Go binary as a failure; `rust`: `cargo --version` read back; `node`: `node --version` read back; `python`: `python3` + `venv` — plus the fixed base set (`python3`, `git`, `curl`, `tar`, `sha256sum`) and WARN-only `jq`/`rg`. The kind set comes from evidence, first hit wins, and the `kinds` row names which evidence produced it: **(a)** `--kinds <csv>` / `NODE_KINDS` (`go,rust,node,python,generic`), validated before any layer runs — an empty or unknown element is a named `FAIL kinds` and exits 1; **(b)** the workspace `$HOME/repo` when a clone is already present (`go.mod`→go, `Cargo.toml`→rust, `package.json`→node, `pyproject.toml`\|`setup.py`→python); **(c)** the generic fallback, which the layer **prints as a fallback** (`WARN kinds — generic fallback …`) instead of silently grading the old fixed list. `node` keeps its pre-CF-218 WARN shape only in that fallback; once `node` is a declared or derived kind its absence is `FAIL tool:node`. The layer prints its own census command — `bash scripts/project-node.sh --check --project <p> --layers 10`, one node per run — so the fleet counts it was written against can be re-measured: 61 distinct repo origins, go 27, node 22, python 16, rust 5 (CF-218, CF-219). Under `--apply` a `node` kind is **provisioned**, not only graded: `scripts/install-node.sh` installs the digest-pinned `v22.22.3` archive under `$HOME/node-toolchain`, reads that binary's `--version` back, and the layer grades `$HOME/node-toolchain/current/bin/node` before any PATH runtime. A fresh node had no `node` at all, so a Go repo whose tests shell out to it failed 11 tests while this layer printed a green — the row graded an ambient PATH binary it had never installed (CF-003) | preflight |
| 20 harness | the harness binary plus the adapter's own gate rows, printed verbatim (`python`, `binary`, `version`, `port`, `inference_key`, and `gateway_start` when that block runs); `gateway_start` is a refusal on any node whose `~/.hermes/config.yaml` does not parse to a non-empty `dashboard.basic_auth` username and password (`scripts/harness/install-hermes.sh:119–266`). Before the adapter runs, this layer stages that block through `scripts/node_gateway_auth.py` (`--apply`) or reports whether it is already there (`--check`; read-only, and an absent block is a FAIL because the consequence is a refused gateway). The password is generated on the node into `$HOME/.node/auth/gateway.pass`, mode 600, and is never printed or passed in argv (CF-150) | base |
| 30 bus | a crier identity file at `$HOME/.node/crier.json` and its mode 600 | harness |
| 40 repo | the repo cloned at a pinned ref, and the checkout measured against `origin/main` by `scripts/node_freshness.py` (or its node-side fallback): branch, HEAD, ancestry, lag, uncommitted paths (`scripts/project-node.sh`, `freshness_measure`). With `NODE_DEPLOY_KEY` declared, the clone runs under `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F <ssh_config>'` built from a mode-600 per-repo key; a key readable by group/other **blocks the clone** instead of falling back to an ambient identity, and `core.sshCommand` is pinned into that one repository afterwards (CF-003) | base |
| 90 verify | the node manifest (`$HOME/.node/node.json`), written only when every layer passed | all |

Three capabilities that the design describes are **not** established by any shipped layer, and this
table no longer claims them:

- **A started gateway on a freshly created node — the gate is satisfied, the start is not
  certified.** Layer 20 runs the adapter with `--apply`, and the adapter starts `hermes serve` only
  when `~/.hermes/config.yaml` parses to a non-empty `dashboard.basic_auth` username and password
  (`scripts/harness/install-hermes.sh:119–266`, gate at `:351–369`); otherwise it prints
  `FAIL gateway_start — refused: a public bind needs dashboard.basic_auth in ~/.hermes/config.yaml`.
  The create path now WRITES that block instead of assuming it: `scripts/node-create.sh
  --staged-files` stages eight files — `project-node.sh`, `install-go.sh`, `lib.sh`,
  `disk_floor.py`, `reclaim_disk.py`, `node_gateway_auth.py`, `harness/harness-vars.sh` and
  `harness/install-hermes.sh` — and layer 20 runs `node_gateway_auth.py` before the adapter, which
  writes the block and a mode-600 `$HOME/.node/auth/gateway.pass` on the node, the password never
  printed and never in argv (CF-150). What that is worth is measured against a fixture, not a live
  node: `tests/selftest.sh` §55 shows the same adapter printing the refusal above and never
  launching `serve` without the block, and `PASS gateway_start — /api/status -> 200` with it. No
  created node has run this ladder since the change, and `NODE: PASS` still needs every row,
  including the `inference_key` this repo cannot supply. Whether a bunker agent image already ships
  that file is **not measured** by this repo.
- **A node-side bus worker.** Layer 30 starts and checks no process and opens no socket:
  `scripts/project-node.sh:244-249` tests `-f $STATE/crier.json`, then `stat -c '%a'` against `600`,
  and prints `crier_identity` / `crier_mode`. Whether a worker is running on the node is unmeasured
  by this ladder; CF-068 owns the file-existence weakness this layer still has.
- **A round trip whose digest is recomputed on the control host.** Layer 90 prints `[90] manifest`
  and writes `$HOME/.node/node.json` (`scripts/project-node.sh:294-312`); it recomputes no artifact
  digest and consults no control host. That criterion is what the runbook calls NOT YET
  (`docs/OPERATIONS.md` §6), CF-004 owns building it, and `AGENTS.md` rule 4 keeps it as the proof
  a node works — it is the standard layer 90 is graded against, not something layer 90 delivers.

Layer 40's cell was narrowed to the clone alone for the same reason (`6f75e28`, CF-032); CF-244
widened it to the clone plus its measured freshness against `origin/main`, because a clone that is
behind or dirty is a tree the node cannot fast-forward — the failure `verify-node.sh` had no arm
for. Every cell in this table now names only something the shipped script measures or prints.

### Fixture scope (`--layers`)

A run costs every layer's work, but a test that asserts one layer's row needs that layer only.
`project-node.sh --layers 00,10,20,30,40` runs only the named check layers: a comma-separated
subset of `00,10,20,30,40`, where a single value is a list of one. An unknown element, an empty
list or a stray comma prints the usage line to stderr and exits 2 before any layer runs, so a
half-applied scope can never reach layer 00.

A scoped run is a **fixture**, never a certification:

- it prints one `SCOPE: layers <list> (fixture mode — not a node certification)` line before
  layer 00, and `  SKIP  layer NN (out of scope)` in the position each skipped layer would have
  taken;
- it never writes `$HOME/.node/node.json`, even under `--apply` with every in-scope layer green:
  layer 90 reports `  SKIP  layer 90 (fixture mode: no manifest)` instead, so **N-4** holds by
  construction — no manifest, no node identity;
- it does not resolve the disk floor when `00` is out of scope, because nothing measures or
  consumes it and a fixture installs nothing (the fail-closed floor path keeps its coverage on
  unscoped runs, `tests/selftest.sh` section 13);
- the summary line keeps its existing shape (`NODE: PASS` / `NODE: FAIL (n)`); the absence of a
  manifest, not the summary, is what makes a scoped run non-certifying.

An unscoped run is unchanged in every respect: same rows, same order, same manifest behaviour,
same exit codes.

## Laws

- **N-1** No root. Any step needing sudo is wrong.
- **N-2** Idempotent. A second `--apply` changes nothing and exits 0.
- **N-3** Every check names the measured value.
- **N-4** The manifest is written only after each layer's check passes.
- **N-5** A node refuses to start work below the disk floor, and says the number; reap before refusing.
- **N-6** Destroying the agent destroys the node; the scripts must rebuild it exactly.

## Credentials — per-repo deploy keys

A private repo is cloned with a key that belongs to **that repo**, never with an account key and
never with an identity the agent happens to have. The whole path is `scripts/deploy_key.py`:

```
scripts/deploy_key.py install --home ~ --repo git@gitlab.example:group/repo.git --key <file>
scripts/deploy_key.py check   --home ~ --repo git@gitlab.example:group/repo.git
```

`install` refuses a key that is group/other-readable (`FAIL key_mode — … is 0644`), a public key,
an HTTPS remote (a deploy key authenticates SSH; it cannot authenticate HTTPS) and a non-SSH path;
it copies the bytes into `$HOME/.node/keys/<name>.key` at mode 600, regenerates
`$HOME/.node/keys/ssh_config` (one `Host` block per host, `IdentitiesOnly yes`, `BatchMode yes`,
`StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new`, one `IdentityFile` per repo) and records the repo→key mapping in
`$HOME/.node/keys/keys.json`. `check` proves the file mode, the config's agreement with the registry
and prints the **one** clone command a stranger can paste:

```
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F ~/.node/keys/ssh_config' GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git clone --depth 1 --branch main <repo> ~/repo
```

`scripts/node-create.sh --deploy-key <file>` is the spawn path: the credential is validated on the
control host **before any agent is spawned** — the file is readable, its mode is 600/400, and it
must load as an **unencrypted private key** (`ssh-keygen -y`, the same client that will present it),
with the remote in SSH form. A mode-600 `.pub`, a non-key file, a passphrase-protected key and an
HTTPS (or local-path) remote are each a named refusal there — `FAIL deploy_key:loadable` /
`FAIL deploy_key:repo` — so the failure lands before an agent exists instead of after its bytes have
been copied in. The key is then copied to the node as a file (never an argv value), installed by
`deploy_key.py`, and the incoming copy is deleted in the same round trip. `project-node.sh`
layer 40 consumes it as `NODE_DEPLOY_KEY` (+ optional `NODE_SSH_CONFIG`): the clone runs under a
process-scoped `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, and `core.sshCommand` is written into that one repository after a
successful clone so later fetches use the same identity. **Read-only is the key's server-side grant**;
the client cannot prove it, and this repo does not claim it: what is proven locally is the 0600
file, the `IdentitiesOnly` config, and that the clone uses them. Cloning the real private GitLab
from a fresh node with a real read-only key is a live obligation (`tests/test_node_provisioning.py`
proves the mechanism against a fixture; see "Verification" there).

## Disk floor

Measured components per repo node: 97 MB repo + 656 MB module cache + toolchain + harness. Build cache is not provisioned by shipped scripts and is excluded.

Floor = repo + harness + 2 GB working room. The ladder reads free space and refuses below the floor **with the number in the refusal**.

**Shared module cache.** The 656 MB is the same bytes for every node of a repo, so it is seeded
once and sealed read-only rather than re-downloaded per node:

```
scripts/gomodcache.py init  --dir /srv/cf/gomod
scripts/gomodcache.py seed  --dir /srv/cf/gomod --module <repo>
scripts/gomodcache.py seal  --dir /srv/cf/gomod     # chmod a-w, record bytes/entries
scripts/gomodcache.py check --dir /srv/cf/gomod     # FAILs on any write bit or size drift
scripts/gomodcache.py wire  --dir /srv/cf/gomod     # go env -w GOMODCACHE=<dir>
```

A sealed cache makes the no-re-download property **checkable**: with the proxy disabled
(`GOPROXY=off`) a build that touches an already-seeded module succeeds and adds 0 bytes, while a
module that is absent is refused with `permission denied` instead of silently growing the cache.
Declaring the cache on a node (`NODE_GOMODCACHE`, passed by `node-create.sh --gomodcache`) makes
layer 10 print its size and refuse it when it is writable or has drifted; when it is not declared the
layer says so (`WARN go:modcache — this node keeps a private module cache`) rather than leaving the
absence unexplained.

**Footprint admission.** Layer 00 measures the components this node will occupy
(`scripts/node_hygiene.py footprint`: checkout, `node-toolchain`, `go-toolchain`, `.hermes`, `.node`
and a declared module cache), prints each size, and refuses admission when the total plus 2 GiB of
working room exceeds free space, or when the total exceeds the resolved floor. An undeclared module
cache reports `not-declared`, never a silent zero.

**Orphan reaping.** A bunker host accumulates homes and keys whose agent no longer exists. They are
reaped against the server's own agent list, never against a guess:

```
BUNKER_HOMES_DIR=<dir> BUNKER_KEYS_DIR=<dir> scripts/bunker-server-install.sh --reap-orphans
# or, directly:
scripts/node_hygiene.py reap --homes-dir D --keys-dir D --registry <list> [--apply]
```

Check mode removes nothing and exits non-zero for every orphan it would remove, so it gates a
scale-up; apply mode removes only entries whose id is absent from the registry, older than the grace
window, and directly under the named directory. Symlinks are never followed and the target of one is
never touched.

Before refusing, `--apply` runs `scripts/reclaim_disk.py run --root "$HOME" --dry-run --json`
(a rehearsal that prints the projected set and deletes nothing) and then the same call without
`--dry-run`, against bounded user-space targets: `.cache/pip`, `.cache/uv`, `.cache/pre-commit`,
`.cache/go-build`, and `.npm/_cacache` are removed only when the **newest mtime anywhere in their
subtree** exceeds the cache TTL (default 24 hours, configurable with `--cache-ttl-hours`), and
immediate job directories under `.node/jobs` and stale clones under `.node/clones` are removed only
when the same measure exceeds the job TTL (default 24 hours, `--job-ttl-hours`). A cache written
seconds ago is kept, because a directory's own mtime does not move when a file deep inside it is
rewritten.
Targets are fixed, resolved inside the real root, and symlinks are never followed.
The repo and node identity/configuration files are never targets. The reclaimer
refuses `/` and non-directory roots, supports `--dry-run`, and reports reclaimed bytes
plus the deleted set. The ladder re-measures free space after reclaim and refuses only if still
below the floor. `--check` never reclaims: it reports the existing disk failure, explains what
`--apply` would reap first, and keeps measuring the other layers.

### Configurable floors (roles)

The floor is operator policy, so it is configurable — and the precedence is fixed, highest first:

| Rung | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `--disk-floor <GiB>` | `project-node.sh --check --disk-floor 8` |
| 2 | `NODE_DISK_FLOOR` | `NODE_DISK_FLOOR=8G` |
| 3 | config `[disk] <role>_gib` | `worker_gib = "8"` |
| 4 | config `[disk] default_gib` | `default_gib = "6"` |
| 5 | built-in role default | see below |

Role defaults: `worker` 5 GiB, `builder` 10 GiB, `full` 20 GiB. The role is selected with `--role` or `NODE_ROLE`. Accepted value forms: `7`, `7G`, `7GiB`, `1.5G` in GiB, bounded to 1–4096. A decimal is **preserved**, never truncated: `1.5G` is a 1.5 GiB floor and `5.9G` is a 5.9 GiB floor, so admission enforces the number the operator wrote (CF-082); whole values stay whole numbers (`5G` resolves to `5`, not `5.0`).

A malformed value fails closed **before** any install, clone or adapter run: `FAIL disk-floor: NODE_DISK_FLOOR: 'plenty' is not a size…`. A typo never lowers a floor, and a below-floor node refuses admission naming both the measured free space and the configured floor, plus the source that set it.

Config file location: `--config`, `NODE_DISK_FLOOR_CONFIG`, or `$HOME/.node/floor.toml`. See `examples/floor.toml.example`.

Resolver: `python3 scripts/disk_floor.py resolve --role builder --explain` prints `{"role":…,"floor_gib":…,"source":…}`; `python3 scripts/disk_floor.py roles` lists defaults.

## Workdir targets

A lane's `workdir` is a **target**, not a local directory string. Remote execution means the workdir can live on another host, addressed the way people address remote paths:

| Form | Kind | Example |
|---|---|---|
| absolute / `~` path | local | `/home/agent/code-factory` |
| `local:` / `file://` | local | `local:/srv/cf` |
| `user@host:path` | remote (ssh/scp style) | `builder@node-01:/srv/code-factory` |
| `ssh://user@host[:port]/path` | remote | `ssh://builder@node-01:2222/srv/cf` |
| `sftp://` / `ftp://` / `ftps://` / `rsync://` | remote | `sftp://deploy@mirror/srv/cf` |
| `bunker://<agent>/path` | remote (bunker identity) | `bunker://cf-worker/srv/cf` |

Rules:

- `scripts/lane_target.py parse <target>` structurally validates and emits the components as JSON; unparseable or relative local paths exit 2.
- `verify` on a **local** target proves it is a real checkout: directory exists, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` succeeds, the top level is **not `$HOME`** (the stand-in locator defect where a lane reads the home repo's board), the top level matches the target, a remote exists, and HEAD is an attached branch.
- `verify` on a **remote** target is `remote-structural-only`: reachability and existence are NOT checked locally, and that must be requested explicitly with `--allow-remote` (exit 3 otherwise). A remote target is never silently treated as verified.
- `verify --exec-bunker [--bunker-server S]` on a **bunker** target proves it against the agent itself: `bunker exec <agent> -- sh -lc 'echo $HOME; test -d <path>'` must return a home and an existing directory. Checks recorded: `bunker_cli`, `agent_reachable`, `path_exists`.
- `lane_target.py plan <projects.jsonl> --agent <id> --server <server> [--suffix /repo] [--prefix P]` emits the intended `bunker://<agent>/<home><suffix>` target per lane. The agent's home is **resolved from the agent**, never templated: homes are `/home/bunker-<full-id>`, so a `{agent}` template builds a wrong path that still parses.
- `lane_target.py scan <projects.jsonl> [--allow-remote]` checks every row and exits nonzero if any target is invalid.
- `scripts/node_freshness.py --agent A --server S [--path REL]` proves the **checkout** a node will work is the tree `origin/main` has: branch, HEAD, whether HEAD is an ancestor of `origin/main`, the lag count and the files that differ, plus every uncommitted path — gathered in ONE `bunker exec` round trip, with the agent's home resolved from the agent (never templated). `--workdir PATH` measures a local checkout with no bunker, no network and no database; `--json` emits the object layer 90 stores in the manifest. Exit codes: `0` PASS, `1` drift or dirty, `2` usage or unreachable — an unmeasurable node is not a PASS. A repo with no `origin` remote is a FAIL naming that, and the comparison ref falls back to `origin/HEAD` (named in the row) so a `trunk`-default repo is measured instead of mislabelled. `scripts/verify-node.sh` folds the verdict into `VERIFY:` (step 5; unmeasurable is WARN unless `--strict-freshness`).
- `scripts/node_seed_drift.py --agent A --server S` (or `--home DIR`) proves the **seed** a node carries is still what its digest record pins: it runs `scripts/node_seed.py`'s own `check` — the seeder is staged to a temp path on the node and removed again inside ONE `bunker exec` round trip, because provisioning deletes the node-side copy after it applies — with the record the seed left (`$HOME/.hermes/seed-applied.json`, home `$HOME`), so the verdict is the instrument's own and the wrapper cannot drift from it. The PASS row counts the seeded files and **only a count greater than zero can produce one**: a record whose `files` collection is empty — or absent, or not a list — is refused with `FAIL seed_drift — <record>: the record declares no files (<shape>) — an empty seed certifies nothing` and exit `1`, because nothing it declares could agree with anything on the node, while the seeder's own `check` prints the same `0 files present and matching` row and exits 0 for it (CF-379: `0 files present and matching` certified a node whose seed applied nothing). No reason field on the record rescues it: the probe exists to prove digests, and a record that names none proves nothing; a node that is meant to carry no seed should carry no seed record, which is the absent-record WARN below. The FAIL row names each drifted path with the expected and measured digest prefixes and each path absent on the node; the wrapper never reimplements the digest comparison. Exit codes: `0` matched, `1` drift (or a record that declares no files, or an absent record under `--strict-seed`), `2` usage, `3` could not measure — a node still being provisioned has no seed record, a corrupt record is not a tampered copy, and "cannot measure" is not drift; both are WARN, and `--strict-seed` refuses the unknown. `scripts/verify-node.sh` folds it into `VERIFY:` as step 6: a drifted seed alone drives `VERIFY: FAIL`, a record that declares no files drives `VERIFY: FAIL` the same way (the checker's exit `1` is already the `bad` branch — no new verb), and an unmeasurable seed is WARN (FAIL under `--strict-seed`).
- Lane writers (`scripts/configure_family.py`) only `mkdir` a **local** target; a remote target is registered verbatim and materialised by the node side.

## Transport — how the control host reaches a node's gateway

**A bunker node has no LAN address by default.** The agent runs in its own network namespace, so the
address `hostname -I` answers inside it (`172.x`, `10.x`) is one the control host cannot route to.
Any claim that such a node is "reachable" has to name the path the request actually took. On a node
that shares a LAN with the control host — the original case — the node's own address is that path;
anywhere else it is not, and a verifier that assumes it will report a green node as unverified (or,
worse, certify one by probing a loopback address that answers on the control host).

`scripts/verify-node.sh` therefore takes an explicit transport, and **every row it prints names the
transport that carried the probe, with the HTTP code it measured**:

| `--transport` | What it is | Where the probe runs | Can it produce `VERIFY: PASS`? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `node-address` (default) | the node's own address from `hostname -I` | control host | yes — **only** when that address is not loopback and the control host can reach it (the LAN case) |
| `published-port` | a port published on the bunker host for this agent's gateway (`--transport-address HOST:PORT`) | control host | yes — the request leaves this host and arrives at the node as an outside request |
| `tunnel` | an SSH forward opened on the control host to the node's gateway (`ssh -N -L 18080:127.0.0.1:10800 …`, then `--transport-address 127.0.0.1:18080`) | control host, into the forward | yes — a loopback endpoint is legal here **because the declaration says what it is**: the request originates on this host and re-enters the node through the tunnel |
| `bunker-exec` | the probe run through the bunker CLI, INSIDE the node (`curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/…`) | the node itself | **never** |

Why these three and not a fourth: publishing a port needs no credential in the node and no local
daemon; a tunnel needs only the SSH access the operator already has to the bunker host; and running
the probe through the bunker CLI needs nothing but the CLI — but it measures the node's own loopback,
so it is kept as a diagnostic and graded `FAIL`. `--transport published-port|tunnel` requires
`--transport-address HOST:PORT` and refuses to invent one; `NODE_TRANSPORT` and
`NODE_TRANSPORT_ADDRESS` carry the same values into a spawn path (`scripts/node-create.sh` runs the
verifier as a child, so an exported pair reaches it without new argv).

Two graded consequences:

- **A loopback inside the node is a `FAIL`, not a `PASS`.** `--transport bunker-exec` prints
  `FAIL gateway_reachable — loopback inside the node -> 200 (transport: bunker-exec) — a request
  that did not leave the node proves nothing about reachability, so this is a FAIL, not a PASS` and
  the run ends `VERIFY: FAIL (n)`. It reports the code it measured so the operator can see the
  harness is up; it still refuses to certify the node.
- **An unavailable transport is named, never `000`.** When the declared transport answers nothing,
  the row says which one and to what endpoint — `WARN gateway_reachable — no published port for
  cf-node:10800 (nothing answered at <host>:10800)` / `no tunnel endpoint for cf-node:10800 …` /
  `no route from this host to <ip>:10800 (a bunker node has no LAN address by default — pass
  --transport published-port or --transport tunnel)` — and the run ends `VERIFY: UNVERIFIED`,
  exit 3. That is distinct from `FAIL` on purpose: nothing is broken and nothing is proven. A
  *non-200 answer* from the transport (404, 500) stays a `FAIL`, because the node was reached and
  answered wrongly. A node that reports only a loopback address is refused the same way — probing
  it from here would measure the control host's own loopback, not the node.

What this still does not prove: that the port or tunnel an operator declares is the node's gateway
rather than some other listener, and any round trip whose artifact digest is recomputed on the
control host (that remains CF-004). The transport proves the request came from outside the node,
not what the node did with it.

## Failure semantics

- Gateway unreachable through the declared transport → `VERIFY: UNVERIFIED`, exit 3, naming the
  transport and the endpoint (`no published port for cf-node:10800`). The node is not called broken
  and it is not certified; a *non-200 answer* through a working transport is a FAIL instead. A probe
  that never left the node (`--transport bunker-exec`) is a FAIL, whatever it measured.
- Harness down → layer 20 FAIL; no work is accepted.
- Bus identity missing → layer 30 FAIL; the node is invisible, which is worse than empty.
- Repo dirty at provision time → WARN, not FAIL (the node may be mid-task); `verify` still runs.
  The uncommitted paths are named and recorded (`$HOME/.node/freshness.json`, and the manifest's
  `freshness` object), because the edit belongs upstream, not in the node's tree.
- Repo drifted at provision time (behind or diverged from `origin/main`, i.e. the pull cannot
  fast-forward) → FAIL under `--apply`: the node would work a tree that no longer matches
  `origin/main`. Neither condition is repaired silently by the ladder.
- Round trip fails → the node is quarantined; the scheduler must not send it more work.
