# TRACE — the identity ladder: one dispatch, six ids, no gaps

Status: **DESIGN + GAP REGISTER.** `specs/ENVELOPE.md` already defines `corr_id`, `dispatch_id` and
`idempotency_key` (`specs/ENVELOPE.md:12`, `:61`), and the round-trip probe measured that the chain
breaks in practice: five unacked replies carried `in_reply_to` and **none** carried `corr_id`
(`/home/kara/code-factory-reports/crier-scheduler-roundtrip-2026-11-05.md:258`). This page fixes the
whole ladder and names every break.

## 1. The problem

A board row is **not** a run. `CF-212` can be dispatched on Monday, fail, be re-dispatched Tuesday and
succeed. Both runs touch the same row, both write the same board file, and today **nothing
distinguishes them**: the row id is the only identity in play, so "which attempt failed, and what did
it do differently" is unanswerable from logs.

Every layer mints its own id and none of them are joined on purpose:

| layer | id it has today | minted by | problem |
|---|---|---|---|
| board | `CF-nnn` | `boardctl` | identifies the WORK, not an attempt — reuse is normal |
| scheduler | `corr_id` = `lane-<ts>-<seq>` (`specs/ENVELOPE.md:12`) | scheduler dispatch | not a UUID; two dispatches in one second rely on a sequence counter |
| crier | message id (24-hex) | crier | unique, but only correlated if the sender sends the key |
| hermes session | session id | gateway | not told which dispatch it serves |
| node run | `CF_RUN_ID` (`specs/HARNESS-MATRIX.md`) | envelope | absent in one dispatcher path (G2) |
| artifact | commit SHA / digest | node | no link back to the run that produced it |

## 2. The ladder — six identities, one chain

    board row  CF-nnn                      the WORK (many attempts)
       |
       +-- attempt  run_id  = UUIDv7       ONE dispatch, minted by the scheduler, never reused
              |
              +-- corr_id                  the scheduler's join key  (kept: it is what replies carry)
              +-- crier message id         the transport
              +-- session id               the agent that did the work
              +-- node run record          R1/R2 (specs/FLEET-MEMORY.md)
              +-- artifacts                commit SHA, file digests
              +-- board event              the row's own history entry, carrying run_id

**Rules:**

1. **The scheduler mints `run_id` per dispatch attempt**, as a UUIDv7 (time-ordered, so a week's runs
   sort by id). `CF-nnn` may appear in many `run_id`s; a `run_id` belongs to exactly one row and one
   attempt.
2. **Every hop records the ids it received.** A hop that invents an id without carrying the parent is
   broken, not merely lossy.
3. **`corr_id` stays** — it is the scheduler's existing join key and replies already speak it. `run_id`
   is its parent, not its replacement.
4. **No ids in prose.** If a log line, metric, board event or DuckBrain record names a run, it names
   `run_id` first.
5. **An attempt that never reaches the node still gets a `run_id`** — a dispatch that crier rejected is
   a run that failed, and it must be visible as such rather than as a gap in the numbering.

## 3. Propagation contract, hop by hop

| hop | must carry | must record | failure if absent |
|---|---|---|---|
| scheduler → crier | `run_id`, `corr_id`, `idempotency_key`, `board_row`, `lane`, `attempt` | its own dispatch log line with all five | a redelivery is indistinguishable from a new attempt |
| crier → inbox | the payload plus its own message id | message id ↔ `run_id` mapping, readable by the control host | the reply cannot be matched to the request |
| crier → reply | `in_reply_to` **and** `corr_id` **and** `run_id` | the correlation it used | today: five replies with `in_reply_to` only (`…roundtrip-2026-11-05.md:258`) |
| control host → hermes session | `run_id` in the session's opening context | session id ↔ `run_id` | a session cannot be traced to the dispatch that caused it |
| session → node | `CF_RUN_ID` = `run_id`, `CF_LANE`, `CF_NAMESPACE` | echoed into every record it writes | the run's memory writes are unattributable |
| node → control host | `run_id` in the result envelope | R1 + R2 (`specs/FLEET-MEMORY.md:28`, `:38`) | the fleet index has runs it cannot join |
| node → git | commit trailer `Run-Id: <run_id>` | commit SHA ↔ `run_id` | an artifact cannot be traced to an attempt |
| foreman → board | a board event naming `run_id` and the outcome | row history | the row shows a status change with no cause |

## 4. Where it breaks today — measured

| id | break | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | replies carry `in_reply_to`, never `corr_id` | five unacked replies, `…roundtrip-2026-11-05.md:258`; only one `in_reply_to` matched a tick (`:270`) |
| T2 | one dispatcher path omits `reply_to` and `text` entirely | report §G2, `cmd/scheduler-dispatch/main.go:137-142` |
| T3 | `reply_to` exists only inside the payload, not as a first-class field | report §G3 |
| T4 | no `run_id` exists at all: `corr_id` is timestamp+sequence, reused per lane | `specs/ENVELOPE.md:12` |
| T5 | a session is never told which dispatch it serves | nothing in the session-open path carries `corr_id` or `run_id` |
| T6 | commits carry no run attribution | no trailer in `scripts/land-node-branch.sh` or the node's commit path |
| T7 | the board's own history does not distinguish attempts | rows record status, not attempts |

## 5. What the operator can ask once this holds

1. *"Show every attempt on CF-212, with outcomes."* — `list_keys` prefix on the row, or the board
   event stream filtered by `board_row`.
2. *"This commit broke main; which run produced it?"* — `git log --grep 'Run-Id:'`.
3. *"This session used the wrong model; which dispatch was it?"* — session id → `run_id` → dispatch.
4. *"Which runs failed at the crier hop last week, and why?"* — R2 records with `outcome: FAIL` whose
   last hop is transport.
5. *"How many attempts did the fleet need per completed row this month?"* — the number nobody can
   compute today, and the one that says whether dispatch is healthy.

## 6. Verification — what must be true before this page says "implemented"

1. Two consecutive dispatches of one board row produce **two distinct `run_id`s**, both mapping to the
   row, and the second is visibly later in a sort.
2. A reply carries `in_reply_to`, `corr_id` **and** `run_id`; a reply missing either is refused by the
   scheduler rather than counted as uncorrelated.
3. A hermes session created for a dispatch can be found from its `run_id` alone (session id recorded
   against it at open).
4. A node commit carries `Run-Id: <run_id>` and `git log --grep` finds it.
5. A dispatch that crier refused still has a `run_id` and a `FAIL` record.
6. Killing the node after the envelope but before the result leaves a `run_id` with no result — and a
   query that says so, rather than a run that vanished.

## 7. Scope and non-goals

In scope: minting, propagation, recording, and the queries in §5. Out of scope: log shipping, sampling,
and the scheduler's own metrics schema (that is the scheduler repo's spec). This page defines the join
key; the stores that index it are each store's own business, provided they record it.

## 8. Inherited defects

| id | what |
|---|---|
| CF-216 | `specs/ENVELOPE.md` matches neither implementation (timings and fields) |
| CF-253 | a 1800 s stream timeout makes a stalled request look like a hung job — with `run_id` this is distinguishable |
| CF-276 | `node-create.sh` does not stage `node-bus-worker.py`, so a fresh node may have no `CF_RUN_ID` consumer at all |
| CF-208 | the DuckBrain token is not namespace-scoped, so R2 cannot be trusted as a cross-project index until it is |
