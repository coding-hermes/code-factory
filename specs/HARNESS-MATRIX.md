# SPEC — harness matrix

Which harness runs which model, what every harness must be given, how the choice is switched, and
what it must report back.

This is the design authority for the harness work; `specs/HARNESS.md` owns the adapter contract,
`specs/NODE.md` owns the node, and this file owns the **selection rule**, the **variable contract**
and the **switching model**.

Measured inputs: `/home/kara/code-factory-reports/spec-crier-harness-support-2026-11-05.md` (what
crier ships, file:line), `/home/kara/code-factory-reports/spec-bunker-toolchain-2026-11-05.md` (what
a node must install), and npm registry metadata read on 2026-11-05 for the versions in §2.

---

## 1. The invariants

**I1 — The foreman is always Hermes.** Every lane that grades, closes a row, writes the board, or
decides "this is done" runs on Hermes, on the node, with the coding-hermes skills loaded. No model
choice changes this: the foreman owns the evidence chain (`boardctl`, tick accounting, artifact
digests), and a harness that cannot write the board cannot be the foreman.

**I2 — The harness is a per-lane SETTING, not a property of the model.** Any model may run in any
harness that can host it (§3). "An OpenAI model in Claude Code" and "a Claude model in Codex" are
legitimate configurations, not mistakes — an operator may want one harness's editing loop on
another provider's price, or a sandbox they trust around a model they do not. §2's defaults are
defaults.

**I3 — Every supported harness reports one canonical record to the same DuckBrain namespace.** The
record is exactly this object (all values are non-empty strings):

```json
{"commit":"<sha>","harness":"<name>","harness_version":"<version>","lane":"<lane>","model_requested":"<id>","model_served":"<id-or-unavailable:reason>","namespace":"<project-namespace>","provider_binding":"<native-or-shim/name>","run_id":"<bus-run-id>","tick":"<tick-or->"}
```

The key order above is illustrative; the canonical bytes are UTF-8 JSON with sorted keys, compact
separators and no ASCII escaping. `scripts/harness/harness_memory.py` is the one writer and reader
used by the conformance fixture (and is a seam for a future DuckBrain adapter). It must be given the
project namespace explicitly, writes no default, and rejects a missing or mismatched namespace.
The conformance `memory` leg writes the record and reads those exact bytes back. A harness that
cannot supply every field — including a real `model_served` or an explicit
`unavailable:<reason>` — is marked `unsupported` in this matrix and is not silently skipped.
This is the requirement that makes the matrix worth having: seven harnesses, one memory.

**Memory support today:** hermes, claude-code, codex, opencode, pi-agent, dsh,
deepseek, opencode-v2, aider and goose are **unsupported for I3 runtime capture**:
none of their actual run paths calls the shared writer or exports the complete provenance.
The conformance memory leg tests a labelled hermetic fixture for each ID, not the live
harness or DuckBrain. In particular dsh cannot distinguish `model_served` from its request.
OMH is an operating layer over Hermes and has no independent exporter. These statuses are
not changed by a fixture PASS; live capture, DuckBrain transport and F3 R1/R2 remain unverified.

**I4 — Nothing is supported because it is installed.** Support means five green legs in the
conformance battery (`PASS`/`SKIP`/`FAIL` with a measured value), on a real node, for a real turn.
`--check` alone is not support.

**I5 — The node refuses what it cannot run, and says which kind of "cannot".** An unknown or
uninstallable harness is `harness_unsupported: <name>; node has: <set>`. A harness that exists but
cannot reach the model's provider is `harness_cannot_host: <harness> <family>` — a different
failure, because one is fixed by installing and the other only by changing configuration.

## 2. The harnesses, measured

| Harness | Package / binary | Version seen | What it is | State in our tree |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **hermes** | `hermes-agent` (pip) / `hermes` | 0.19.0 pin; 0.25.5 live on the control host | model-agnostic agent + gateway; **the foreman** | **MEASURED**: venv install, gateway `/api/status 200`, bus worker READY on `cf-node` |
| **oh-my-hermes (omh)** | `oh-my-hermes` (npm) / `omh` | **4.0.5**; node ≥18; 8 MB; repo `rlaope/oh-my-hermes` | an **operating layer over Hermes**: workflow skills, the `omh` maintenance CLI, and provider/model setup across 13 providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, DeepSeek, GLM, Qwen, Mistral, Llama, MiniMax, Gemma, Moonshot) | not installed; **five same-named forks exist** → provenance check mandatory |
| **opencode** | `opencode-ai` (npm) / `opencode` | host runs 1.18.29 | general coding agent, OSS-model friendly | adapter in crier; installer check-only. **No v2 artefact exists** (`opencode2` is a squatted `0.0.1-security`; `opencode-ai@latest` is 1.19.5) |
| **oh-my-pi (omp)** | `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` (npm) / `pi` adapter alias | **18.16.0**; engine **bun ≥1.4.4**; ~82 MB; repo `can1357/oh-my-pi` | pi's coding agent with session management | `scripts/harness/install-pi-agent.sh` now has a deterministic fixture-backed, user-space ladder; live upstream install and live turn remain **UNVERIFIED** |
| **codex** | codex CLI / `codex` | **0.166.0** pin, read back as `codex-cli 0.166.0` | OpenAI's coding agent; **`exec` is the measured surface** (`codex exec --json -s <mode> -c model_provider="openai" -m <model> -- <text>`), app-server is `[experimental]` and unused in crier | **MEASURED install** (`scripts/harness/install-codex.sh`: musl tarball, sha256-pinned, user-space under `$HOME/.local/codex/<pin>`, idempotent; the same ladder installs the sha256-pinned `codex-code-mode-host` sidecar beside the binary — without it every exec tool call fails closed and a turn exits 0 having written no artifact, CF-006); adapter in crier (`internal/harness/codex/`). The conformance smoke turn **pins `-c model_provider="openai" -m <model>` on argv**: an ambient `~/.codex/config.toml` may name a router this repo never installed, and a turn that inherits it measures that router, not codex |
| **claude-code** | `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` (npm) | **2.1.318 pin**, read back as `2.1.318 (Claude Code)` | Anthropic's coding agent | **MEASURED install ladder** (`scripts/harness/install-claude-code.sh`, CF-225: registry integrity + shasum pinned, user-space npm prefix under `$HOME`, idempotent second `--apply`); **absent from crier entirely** (`CRIER-HARNESS-11`), so it is not a *supported* harness — I4 needs the five legs on a node |
| **deepseek-harness (dsh)** | `@deepseek-ai/dsh` (npm) / `dsh` | **0.2.1-rc.5** pinned; `latest` on the registry is `0.2.2-rc.1`; repo `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness` | DeepSeek's own open-source harness: "everything is a plugin" (Cordis); non-interactive surface `dsh headless "<task>"` (`--json` for NDJSON run events) | **MEASURED install ladder** (`scripts/harness/install-dsh.sh`, CF-226: `npm --prefix` under `$HOME/.local/harness/dsh`, registry integrity + shasum pinned, 618 packages / 858 MB, idempotent second `--apply`, version read back `0.2.1-rc.5`) **and one measured turn** (`dsh-turn.txt` carrying a fixed token, `model` read from dsh's own session record, 25 tools registered, `permission/preset=workspace-write`). No crier adapter: the decision is recorded in `specs/HARNESS.md` §"dsh — the adapter decision" |

**Correction recorded, not quietly edited.** The previous revision of this file said "there is no
deepseek harness". That was measured against *our* two trees and then stated as a fact about the
world. It is real: `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`, CLI `dsh`, npm `@deepseek-ai/dsh`. That it is an
RC at `0.2.x` is a reason to pin it and re-measure often, not a reason to deny it exists. **CF-226
replaced the sentence with a measurement:** `scripts/harness/install-dsh.sh` installs
`@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.1-rc.5` under `$HOME`, reads `dsh --version` back, is idempotent, and runs one
real turn — so the row above no longer says "absent from both repos", it says what was measured.
The pin is an exact prerelease version, and `install-dsh.sh --pin-status` is the one command that
re-measures it: the registry must still serve the recorded `dist.integrity`/`dist.shasum`, and a
newer RC (`0.2.2-rc.1` at the time of writing) is named with the exact three-constant edit that
adopts it. The `deepseek` row the conformance battery also carries probes a **different** binary
named `deepseek`; that one is still unmeasured and its adapter still refuses `--apply` by name.

**oh-my-hermes is a layer, not a peer.** It configures Hermes' providers and installs workflow
skills; it does not replace the agent. That makes it the natural answer to "how do we set up 13
providers on a node without hand-editing YAML", and the natural risk to pin, because its name is
shared by five forks.

---

## 3. What each harness can host

Capability, declared per harness rather than assumed. A harness is usable for a lane when it can
reach the model's provider — natively, through its own provider list, or through a custom
`base_url` pointing at the node's router.

| Harness | Native providers | Custom `base_url` | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| hermes | any (gateway is provider-agnostic) | yes | the reason it is the fallback and the foreman |
| oh-my-hermes | 13 via `omh model setup` | via Hermes | it configures Hermes, so its capability is Hermes' |
| opencode | many OSS providers via config blocks | yes | provider list is a file |
| omp (pi) | pi's provider list | yes | needs the bun runtime |
| codex | OpenAI natively | only if the endpoint speaks the OpenAI shape | cross-provider = proxy or honest refusal |
| claude-code | Anthropic natively; others via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` shim | yes, with a shim | the shim must be named in the record |
| dsh | DeepSeek natively; others via plugins | via plugin | plugin layers mean a failure can be at any layer — diagnose per layer |

**The consequence, stated plainly:** cross-provider execution is a capability of the harness *plus a
shim*, and it must be recorded. A run reporting `model_served: claude-…` that actually went through
a Codex binary is only useful evidence if `provider_binding: shim/<what>` is on the record too.

---

## 4. The resolution rule

```
harness = directive.harness                 # explicit wins (a lane or a run may pin one)
        | lane.harness                      # per-lane setting
        | matrix[lane.model.family]         # the DEFAULT table
        | "hermes"                          # policy fallback
```

Refuse, do not fall back, when: the lane is a foreman lane and the harness is not hermes (I1); the
harness is installed but cannot host the model's provider and no shim is configured
(`harness_cannot_host`); the directive names an unknown harness (`harness_unsupported`).

Record the decision on every run: `harness_selected`, `harness_reason`
(`directive|lane|matrix|fallback`), `model_requested`, `model_served`, `provider_binding`. An
unrecorded fallback is indistinguishable from a mistake, and an unrecorded shim is worse.

---

## 5. The variable contract — what an installer and a harness are given

The same set goes to `scripts/harness/install-<name>.sh --apply` and to the harness at run time
(from the directive, never from the node's ambient environment). Names are stable; a harness that
needs an additional input declares it in its adapter section and adds it here.

| Variable | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `CF_MODEL` | model id requested by task-router | required |
| `CF_PROVIDER` | provider lane (`anthropic`, `openai-codex`, `deepseek`, `pi`, `zai`, …) | required |
| `CF_BASE_URL` | endpoint the harness must talk to (node router, gateway, or shim) | optional; default = node router |
| `CF_API_KEY_FILE` | **path** to a mode-600 file holding the key | required for a paid provider; **a value in argv is a FAIL** (AGENTS.md r8) |
| `CF_WORKDIR` | the clone the harness may write in | required; must be inside `$HOME` |
| `CF_NAMESPACE` | DuckBrain namespace for the run's writes | required (I3) |
| `CF_RUN_ID` | correlation id from the bus envelope | required; echoed into every memory write |
| `CF_LANE` | lane name (e.g. `code-factory-qa`) | required; the node serves one project, many lanes |
| `CF_SKILLS_DIR` | seeded skills root on the node | optional; hermes and omh use it |
| `CF_HARNESS_OPTS` | harness-specific bag (`key=value,key=value`) | optional, **and recorded** — an unrecorded option makes two runs incomparable |
| `CF_MAX_TURNS` / `CF_TIMEOUT_S` | budget | optional; default 40 / 1800 |

Two rules that are cheap now and expensive later: **no credential is ever passed as a value**, and
**no harness may read a model or a key from the node's ambient environment** — the directive is the
only source, so two lanes on one node cannot contaminate each other.

**Implemented once.** `scripts/harness/harness-vars.sh` is the single implementation of this
section: each installer accepts every name below as a flag *and* as a CF_ environment variable,
refuses a credential value (exit 2, the value never echoed) and an ambient provider key, requires
the workdir to exist inside `$HOME`, bounds the budget, and records every name it accepted — so no
declared variable can be accepted and then silently ignored. `scripts/node-bus-worker.py` carries
the same set from the dispatch's `vars` object into the harness child's environment (scrubbing every
ambient CF_ variable first) and writes name + set/unset + length into the result envelope, which is
what lets two runs be compared. `tests/harness-conformance.sh`'s `vars` leg and
`tests/harness/vars-contract-test.sh` are the proofs, per installer.

---

## 6. Switching and management — how it is operated

Switching which harness serves a model is a **configuration change, never a reinstall**:

1. one file per node declares the defaults — `harness.default`, `harness.by_family{…}`,
   `harness.shims{…}` — the same shape as `config/node.env.example`;
2. one per-lane override in the scheduler's lane config (`lane.harness`);
3. one per-run override in the directive (`harness`);
4. `harness_resolve.py --explain <model> [--lane L]` prints the decision and the reason it won, so
   "why did this run in Codex?" is answerable without reading code;
5. changing the file takes effect on the next tick — a swap does not restart the node;
6. every switch is visible: `harness_reason` changes from `matrix` to `lane`/`directive`, which is
   how a reviewer sees that a run was pinned.

Management surfaces: `install-<harness>.sh --check` (installed? which pin), `harness_resolve.py
--explain` (what will run), and the conformance matrix (what actually works).

---

## 7. What "wired up" means, per harness

Five legs. A harness is supported when all five are `PASS` on a real node; `SKIP` is acceptable only
when the reason is named (no credential, no artefact).

| Leg | Proves |
|---|---|
| `check` | the adapter reports absence honestly and a version that was read back |
| `install` | `--apply` is idempotent, user-space, pinned, and the pin is measured after install |
| `vars` | the harness accepts the §5 set, and the **negative** cases fail: a value in argv, an ambient key |
| `turn` | one real turn produces a known artifact (a file with a fixed token) and reports `model_served` |
| `memory` | the run writes the §1-I3 record to DuckBrain with the right namespace and `run_id`, read back |

`tests/harness-conformance.sh` implements this table; its matrix is the release gate for the word
"supported".

---

## 8. Backlog — deliberately not MVP, filed so the loop carries them

None of these blocks a first end-to-end run, and all of them are large:

- **cross-provider matrix (§3)** — measure, per harness, which providers it can reach and via which
  shim; require `provider_binding` on every run;
- **switching/management surface (§6)** — `--explain` plus a safe node-level config editor;
- **oh-my-hermes integration** — decide whether OMH becomes the supported way to configure a node's
  providers (provenance-pinned) or stays optional;
- **dsh crier adapter** — the installer, the pinned ladder, the per-layer diagnosis and one measured
  turn land with CF-226; a crier adapter for `deepseek-harness` is a separate decision, recorded in
  `specs/HARNESS.md` §"dsh — the adapter decision" with what an adapter would have to parse;
- **per-harness provider probing** — a `--probe-provider` leg that asks the harness what it can
  reach instead of trusting this table;
- **harness swap without reprovisioning** — the §6 path proven by a test that flips a family and
  observes the next run's `harness_reason`.

---

## 9. Non-claims

- **opencode v2** has no artefact (`opencode2` = `0.0.1-security`; `opencode-ai@latest` = 1.19.5).
- **claude-code is unimplemented in crier** (`CRIER-HARNESS-11`); the matrix cannot promise it.
- **dsh is an RC** (`0.2.1-rc.5` pinned; `0.2.2-rc.1` is the registry's `latest` at the time of
  writing): pin it to an exact prerelease version, re-measure it with `install-dsh.sh --pin-status`
  before promoting it, and expect plugin-layer failures to need the layer-by-layer diagnosis its own
  startup table describes — `install-dsh.sh --layers` reports package → resolved → enabled → service
  → tool → permission rather than one verdict about the harness.
- **aider and goose** stay out of this matrix: unmeasured, unlisted, not promised, and they ship no
  adapter file at all (`specs/HARNESS.md` names them so the absence is stated, not missing).
